### Hello.

This is my first post on my personal blog. I will write about recently learned concepts, mostly for myself, to remember them better.

Maybe there will be some records of my previous endeavors and discoveries.

Some of these posts I will cross publish on [DEV](https://dev.to/) as it is a great platform for developers to share knowledge.

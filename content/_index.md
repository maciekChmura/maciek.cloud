Hi, I'm Maciek Chmura.

I'm a software engineer. 

Currently, I'm working at [Codete](https://codete.com/) on a full stack application with React and Node.

In my spare time, I bootstrap [archipins](https://archipins.com/). It's a job board for architects with tags and location search.

Professionally, now I'm focusing on:
* expanding my knowledge while building full stack apps
* learning modern tech stacks 

Before discovering what I want to do in my life:
 * I was an architect 
 * experimented with surfboard shaping ðŸ¤£
 * handmade few snowboards
